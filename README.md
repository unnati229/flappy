The file flap_1.py contains the complete code for a Flappy Bird game, a popular side-scrolling game where players control a bird that must navigate through gaps between pipes without crashing. The bird moves forward continuously, and players can control its movement using the keyboard. Pressing the up and down arrow keys allows the bird to move vertically, while pressing the spacebar makes it move in a straight line.The speed of the bird increases with time and similarly the scores. Additionally, players can use the mouse to select different bird types before starting the game. All other files included serve as resources for the game, such as images, sounds, and other assets. The game's user interface is built using Python's inbuilt module, Pygame, which provides tools for handling graphics, animations, and user interactions.
